#Operation exercises 

print(5/2)
print(5.0/2.0)
#python outputs the same value for these operations
print(5%2)
print(10%6) 
print(7%11)
#the modulo operator(%) gives the remainder of division 
print(5**2)
print(10**6)
print(7**11)
#the (**) operator does exponentation 
print(5//2)
print(10//6)
print(7//11)
#the (//) operator does division and gives us the whole number rounded down 
print(5+2+10*6/7)
print(5+2+(10*(6/7)))
print(24+7+10*15/4)
print(24+7+(10*(15/4)))
#python does follow order of operations.
